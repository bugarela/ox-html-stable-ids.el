#+RESULTS:

When publishing HTML with Org mode's exporters, the headlines in the resulting documents get assigned ID attributes.
These are used as anchors, amongst other things.
By default, these are random, so a headline might get assigned ~org81963c6~ as its ID:

#+headers: :cache yes
#+headers: :exports results
#+headers: :results scalar
#+begin_src shell
  cat example.html | grep "<h2 id="
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[bceb2028e92191632ebd6a8816fa0dfa61629e2e]:
: <h2 id="org81963c6">Hello, world!</h2>

Because subsequent exports of the same Org file produce different IDs, there's no way to bookmark a headline.
Instead, it'd be useful to have stable IDs, based on the titles they're attached to.
In the example above, that ID would be "hello-world".
